# School Assignment
<h2>Scenario:</h2>
A local postal service needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.

Your task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages will be delivered on time while meeting each packageâ€™s requirements and keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for both trucks. The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where the postal service has a presence. As such, you will need to include detailed comments to make your code easy to follow and to justify the decisions you made while writing your scripts.
